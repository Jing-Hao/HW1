Hello world!

Although there are only about 12 students taking this class, I think it is quite interesting and useful. I enjoyed doing the assignment because I feel great after seeing my accomplishment on Github.
Our instructer-- Mr. Mike-- is a pretty good person and he helps me a lot with my study.
